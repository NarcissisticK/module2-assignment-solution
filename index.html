			A world-renowned Pakistani dish, biryani is difficult to make but is worth every bit of the effort. Long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with exotic spices, is layered with lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetables, and a thick gravy. The dish is then covered, its lid secured with dough, and then the biryani is cooked over a low flame.
